# Multiple-Imputation-Thesis-project
Code used for the thesis: Is multiple imputation necessary for prediction?

The code is divided into the simulation code, which includes all the functions related to the data generation, imposing of missingness, and the init file to run everything.

The code necessary for analysis & pooling is found in its dedicated folder. The out- and results directory need to be updated for new users and must correspond with existing folder locations.
